# ProjectCoeus

Ideas:
1. Python Utility Package utilizing decorators
  - Timer
  - Memeory usage
  - Data type support finder
  - Labels
  - Benchmark comparions

2. Fractal Map Maker
  - Randomly generated map using an input seed
  - Uses some fractal based generator
  - Can simulate continental drift with major geographic side effects (mountains, trenches)
  - Export to png/svg/mp4

3. Data Structures and Sorts python package
  - Queue, stack, tree, BST...
  - Quicksort, mergesort, bubblesort ...
  - Full pythonic implementations of these (use a lot of built-in methods)

4. Stock Trader (can be simulated for now)
  - Monitors indicators (user specified)
  - Buys/sells on some algorithm/preference/strategy
  - Able to weigh probabilities to choose best strategy to imploy

5. JSoduko solver
